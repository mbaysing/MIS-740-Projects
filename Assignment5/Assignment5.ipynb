    "The most important finding that I found was that California had higher mean usage of all three utilities than Nevada. Which prompted me to also checked to see the breakdown of the environmental impact tiers for California and Nevada. After doing that, it can be seen that California makes up the majority of the high tier and Nevada makes up the majority of the green tier. This correlates with the higher energy usage in California."
